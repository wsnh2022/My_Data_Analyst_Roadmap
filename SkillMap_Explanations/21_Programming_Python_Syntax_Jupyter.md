# Programming (Python): Python Syntax + Jupyter

## 1. Python Syntax (The Basics for Data Analysis)

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simple syntax. For data analysis, you don't need to be a software engineer, but you do need a solid grasp of the fundamentals.

### a) Variables and Data Types

Variables are used to store data. Python has several basic data types:

*   **`int`** (integer): `age = 30`
*   **`float`** (floating-point number): `price = 19.99`
*   **`str`** (string): `name = "Alice"`
*   **`bool`** (boolean): `is_customer = True`

### b) Data Structures

These are used to store collections of data.

*   **`list`**: A mutable (changeable), ordered collection of items. `my_list = [1, "hello", 3.14]`
*   **`tuple`**: An immutable (unchangeable), ordered collection of items. `my_tuple = (1, "hello", 3.14)`
*   **`dict`** (dictionary): A collection of key-value pairs. `my_dict = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}`

### c) Control Flow

*   **`if/elif/else`**: For making decisions.
    ```python
    if age < 18:
        print("Minor")
    elif age < 65:
        print("Adult")
    else:
        print("Senior")
    ```

*   **`for` loops**: For iterating over a sequence (like a list or a dictionary).
    ```python
    # Loop through a list
    for item in my_list:
        print(item)

    # Loop a specific number of times
    for i in range(5):
        print(i) # Prints 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
    ```

### d) Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code. You can define your own functions to perform specific tasks.

```python
def calculate_total(price, quantity):
    return price * quantity

total_cost = calculate_total(10, 5)
print(total_cost) # Prints 50
```

### e) Importing Libraries

No data analyst writes everything from scratch. You will use libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. You import them using the `import` keyword.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
```

## 2. Jupyter Notebook

*   **What it is:** The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It is the **de facto standard environment for interactive data analysis and data science**.

*   **Why is it so popular?**
    -   **Interactive:** You can write and execute code in small chunks (called **cells**), see the output immediately, and make changes iteratively. This is perfect for data exploration.
    -   **Combines Code, Text, and Visuals:** You can mix your Python code with Markdown text (for explanations) and the plots or tables generated by your code. This creates a complete, readable record of your analysis.
    -   **Reproducibility:** A Jupyter notebook can be shared with others, who can then run your code and reproduce your analysis.

### The Jupyter Interface

*   **Cells:** A notebook is made up of cells. The two main types are:
    -   **Code Cells:** Where you write and execute your Python code.
    -   **Markdown Cells:** Where you write your notes, explanations, and format them using Markdown syntax.
*   **Kernel:** The computational engine that executes the code in a notebook. When you start a notebook, you are starting a kernel.

### Realistic Workflow in a Jupyter Notebook

A typical data analysis project in a Jupyter Notebook would look like this:

1.  **Cell 1 (Markdown):**
    ```markdown
    # Analysis of Customer Churn
    In this notebook, we will analyze the customer churn dataset to identify the key drivers of churn.
    ```

2.  **Cell 2 (Code):** Import the necessary libraries.
    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    import seaborn as sns
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    ```

3.  **Cell 3 (Code):** Load the data.
    ```python
    df = pd.read_csv('churn_data.csv')
    df.head()
    ```
    *(You would see the first 5 rows of the DataFrame printed directly below the cell.)*

4.  **Cell 4 (Markdown):**
    ```markdown
    ## Data Exploration
    Let's start by exploring the distribution of our target variable, 'Churn'.
    ```

5.  **Cell 5 (Code):** Create a plot.
    ```python
    sns.countplot(x='Churn', data=df)
    plt.title('Distribution of Customer Churn')
    plt.show()
    ```
    *(The plot would be displayed directly below the cell.)*

...and so on. You would continue this interactive process of writing code, seeing the output, and writing notes until your analysis is complete.

## Summary

-   A solid understanding of **basic Python syntax** (variables, data structures, control flow, functions) is the necessary foundation.
-   The **Jupyter Notebook** is the ideal environment for putting that Python knowledge to work for data analysis.
-   It allows for an **interactive, iterative workflow** that combines code, text, and visualizations, making it perfect for exploring data and sharing your findings.
