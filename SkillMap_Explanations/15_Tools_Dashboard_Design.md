# Tools: Dashboard Design Best Practices

A dashboard is a visual display of the most important information needed to achieve one or more objectives, consolidated and arranged on a single screen so the information can be monitored at a glance.

Creating a dashboard is more than just putting a few charts on a page. Good dashboard design is about **clear communication**. The goal is to create a dashboard that is clean, readable, and provides clear, actionable insights to an executive or any other stakeholder.

## 1. Understand Your Audience and Purpose

Before you even think about charts, ask yourself these questions:

*   **Who is this dashboard for?** (e.g., CEO, Sales Manager, Marketing Analyst)
*   **What is the key question they are trying to answer?**
*   **What decisions will they make based on this dashboard?**
*   **How often will they look at it?** (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly)

The answers to these questions will guide all of your design choices.

**Example:** A CEO needs a high-level, strategic overview of the business (KPIs, trends), while a sales manager needs a more detailed, operational view of their team's performance.

## 2. Structure and Layout

*   **The Inverted Pyramid:** Place the most important, high-level information at the top left. This is where people naturally look first. These are your Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
*   **Logical Flow:** Arrange the rest of the dashboard in a logical flow, from high-level summaries to more detailed breakdowns. Guide your audience through the story.
*   **Use Grids and Alignment:** A well-aligned dashboard looks professional and is easier to read. Don't just randomly place visuals on the page.
*   **Whitespace is Your Friend:** Don't cram too much into one dashboard. Whitespace (empty space) reduces cognitive load and makes the dashboard feel less intimidating.

## 3. Choose the Right Visualizations

Don't just use a chart because it looks cool. Use the chart that best tells the story of your data.

*   **Line Chart:** For showing trends over time.
*   **Bar/Column Chart:** For comparing categories.
*   **Map:** For showing geographical data.
*   **Table/Matrix:** For showing precise values and detailed breakdowns.
*   **KPI Card:** For displaying a single, important number.
*   **Avoid Pie and Donut Charts:** They are generally hard to read accurately, especially with more than 2-3 categories. A bar chart is almost always a better choice.

## 4. Keep it Clean and Simple (The "Less is More" Principle)

*   **Limit Colors:** Use a simple, consistent color palette. Use color strategically to highlight important information, not just for decoration. Be mindful of company branding.
*   **Clear Titles and Labels:** Every chart and axis should be clearly labeled. Don't make your audience guess what they are looking at.
*   **Remove Clutter:** Get rid of anything that doesn't add value. This includes unnecessary borders, gridlines, shadows, and 3D effects. The goal is to maximize the **data-ink ratio** (the amount of ink used to display data vs. the total ink on the graphic).
*   **Consistency:** Use the same fonts, colors, and formatting throughout the dashboard.

---

## 5. Make it Interactive (but not too interactive)

*   **Filters and Slicers:** Allow users to filter the data to what is relevant to them (e.g., by date, region, product category).
*   **Cross-filtering:** Allow clicking on one visual to filter others. This is a powerful way to explore the data.
*   **Drill-down/Drill-through:** Allow users to go from a high-level summary to the underlying details.
*   **Don't overdo it:** Too many filters and options can be overwhelming. Guide the user, don't just give them a sea of data and buttons.
