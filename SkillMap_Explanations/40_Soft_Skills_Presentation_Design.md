# Soft Skills: Presentation Design for Non-Data Stakeholders

Presentation design for a non-data audience is about bridging the gap between your complex analysis and their need for clear, actionable information. These stakeholders (e.g., executives, marketing leads, sales managers) are busy, and they don't care about the technical details of your work. They care about what your findings **mean for the business**.

The goal is to design a presentation that is **simple, clear, and persuasive**.

## The Core Principles

### 1. Bottom Line Up Front (BLUF)

Non-technical audiences, especially senior leaders, are time-poor. Don't make them wait until the end of your presentation for the main point. Start with it.

*   **Your first slide (or your first 30 seconds) should summarize your key finding and your recommendation.**
*   This respects their time and immediately frames the rest of your presentation. The details that follow are simply the evidence supporting your initial conclusion.

### 2. Focus on the "So What?" Not the "How"

Your audience trusts that you have done the analysis correctly. You don't need to spend a lot of time explaining your methodology, the data cleaning process, or the statistical tests you used.

*   **Instead of:** "I performed a K-Means clustering algorithm to segment our users..."
*   **Say:** "I've grouped our customers into three main types based on how they use our product..."

For every piece of information you present, ask yourself: **"So what? Why does this matter to my audience?"**

### 3. One Idea Per Slide

Each slide should have a single, clear message. This makes your presentation much easier to follow.

*   **Use a descriptive title:** The title of the slide should be a full sentence that states the main takeaway of that slide. For example, instead of "Sales Data," use "Sales Grew by 15% in Q3, Driven by the West Region."
*   **Use visuals to support the message:** The chart or graph on the slide should directly illustrate the point you are making in the title.

### 4. Simplicity in Visuals

When presenting to a non-data audience, your charts need to be as simple and clean as possible.

*   **Remove all clutter:** Get rid of gridlines, borders, and unnecessary labels.
*   **Use color strategically:** Use a neutral color (like gray) for the main data and a single, bright color to highlight the most important part of the chart.
*   **Label directly:** Instead of relying on a legend, label the data series directly on the chart.

### 5. Use Analogies and Simple Language

*   Avoid jargon at all costs (e.g., "p-value," "standard deviation," "correlation coefficient").
*   Translate technical concepts into plain English. Instead of "statistically significant," say "this result is very unlikely to be due to random chance."
*   Use analogies to explain complex ideas. For example, you could compare a sales funnel to a real-world funnel to explain the concept of drop-off.

## Realistic Example: A Presentation Slide

**Scenario:** You want to show that a new marketing campaign was successful.

**A Bad Slide for a Non-Data Audience:**
*   **Title:** "Campaign Performance"
*   **Visual:** A dense table of data with rows for each marketing channel and columns for impressions, clicks, conversions, CPA, ROAS, etc.
*   **Spoken Narrative:** "As you can see, the data shows that the new campaign had a high number of impressions..."

**A Good Slide for a Non-Data Audience:**
*   **Title:** "The New Campaign Was Highly Profitable, Delivering a 4x Return on Ad Spend"
*   **Visual:** A single, large KPI card that shows "4x ROAS". Below it, a simple bar chart comparing the ROAS of this campaign to previous campaigns.
*   **Spoken Narrative:** "The key takeaway is that our new campaign was a huge success. For every dollar we invested, we got four dollars back in sales. This is twice as profitable as any of our previous campaigns."
