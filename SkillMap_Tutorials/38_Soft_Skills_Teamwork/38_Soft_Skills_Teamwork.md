### Realistic Example: Contributing to a Shared Dashboard Project

You are part of a team building a sales dashboard. Your task is to create a specific chart.

### 1. Proactive Collaboration

*   **Concept:** Actively seeking opportunities to work with others, share information, and anticipate needs.

    *   **Cross-Functional Communication:** Initiate conversations with non-data stakeholders to understand their needs before they even make a formal request.

### 2. Constructive Feedback

*   **Giving Feedback:**
    *   **Focus on the Work, Not the Person:** "The chart could be clearer" instead of "You made a bad chart."
    *   **Be Specific:** "The x-axis labels are overlapping" instead of "It's hard to read."
    *   **Offer Solutions:** "Perhaps we could rotate the labels or use fewer categories."
*   **Receiving Feedback:**
    *   **Listen Actively:** Don't interrupt. Try to understand the other person's perspective.
    *   **Ask Clarifying Questions:** "Can you show me what you mean?"

### 3. Contributing to Process Improvement

*   **Concept:** Identifying inefficiencies or areas for improvement in team workflows and suggesting solutions.
*   **Example:** Suggesting a standardized naming convention for files, or proposing a regular knowledge-sharing session.

### Realistic Example: Improving a Data Cleaning Process

Your team has a manual data cleaning process that is prone to errors.

*   **Your Intermediate Teamwork:**
    *   You notice recurring errors and suggest automating a part of the cleaning process using a Python script.
    *   You offer to write the script and share it with the team.
    *   You proactively ask a data engineer for advice on best practices for data validation.
    *   When a teammate reviews your script, you actively listen to their feedback and incorporate their suggestions.
