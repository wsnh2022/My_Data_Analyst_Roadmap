# Cheatsheet: Storytelling with Data

## Core Concept
*   **Purpose:** Communicating insights from data using a compelling narrative.
*   **Value:** Makes insights engaging, memorable, and actionable. Gives data context and meaning.

## Structure of a Data Story
1.  **The Setup (Context/Problem):** Why are we here? What's the background/business question?
2.  **The Conflict/Rising Action (Analysis/Findings):** What did you discover? The observations and data points.
3.  **The Climax (The Insight):** The "aha!" moment. The main discovery.
4.  **The Resolution (Recommendation/Action):** What does it mean? What should be done next?

## Key Elements

*   **Key Message:** The single most important takeaway.
