# Cheatsheet: Visualization (Dashboards, Charts)

## Core Purpose
*   **Function:** Graphical representation of information and data.
*   **Goals:**
    *   **Exploration:** Understand data yourself.
    *   **Communication:** Help others understand insights.

## Choosing the Right Chart
*   **Trend over Time:** Line Chart, Area Chart.
*   **Compare Categories:** Bar Chart/Column Chart, Grouped Bar Chart.
*   **Parts of a Whole:** Pie Chart (use sparingly, 2-3 categories), Stacked Bar Chart.
*   **Relationship (2 Numerical):** Scatter Plot.
*   **Distribution (1 Numerical):** Histogram, Box Plot.
*   **Geographical Data:** Map.

## Principles of Effective Visualization
*   **Maximize Data-Ink Ratio:** Remove non-essential elements (gridlines, borders, 3D effects).
*   **Avoid Chartjunk:** No unnecessary visual elements.
*   **Graphical Integrity:** Visual representation should be proportional to numerical quantities (don't truncate axes misleadingly).
*   **Clarity & Simplicity:** Easy to understand at a glance.
*   **Strategic Color:** Use color to highlight, not just decorate.
*   **Clear Titles & Labels:** Every element should be clearly identified.

## Dashboard Design
*   **Concept:** Collection of visualizations on a single screen for overview.
*   **Focused:** Clear purpose, answers specific questions.
*   **Interactive:** Allows user exploration (filters, drill-down).
*   **Clear:** Easy to understand, logical layout.

## Proficiency Levels Summary

### ðŸ”µ Basic
*   Understand the fundamental purpose of data visualization.
*   Select and create basic chart types (line, bar, pie, scatter, histogram) for appropriate data.
*   Understand the importance of clear titles and labels.

### ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate
*   Design charts for clarity, applying principles like maximizing data-ink ratio and strategic use of color.
*   Assemble multiple charts into a simple, interactive dashboard.
*   Incorporate basic interactivity (filters, cross-filtering).
*   Understand the importance of audience and purpose in visualization design.

### ðŸŸ¢ Strong
*   Create complex, multi-layered visualizations (e.g., heatmaps, treemaps, small multiples, geospatial maps).
*   Use visualization as a powerful tool for **data storytelling**, guiding the audience through a narrative.
*   Apply User Experience (UX) principles to dashboard design (intuitive navigation, performance optimization, accessibility).
*   Consistently produce publication-quality visuals that are both aesthetically pleasing and highly informative.
*   Critically evaluate visualizations for potential misrepresentation or bias.
