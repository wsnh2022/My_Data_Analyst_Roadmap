# Cheatsheet: Data Ethics & GDPR

## Data Ethics
*   **Definition:** Moral principles governing data collection, use, sharing, and storage.
*   **Why Essential:** Ensures responsible data use, builds trust, avoids harm.
*   **Core Principles:**
    *   **Privacy:** Respecting individuals' control over personal data.
    *   **Transparency:** Openness about data collection and usage.
    *   **Fairness:** Avoiding discrimination or biased outcomes.
    *   **Accountability:** Taking responsibility for data practices.

## Personal Data (PII)
*   **Definition:** Any information that can identify an individual.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Direct:** Name, email, phone number.
    *   **Indirect:** IP address, location, combined data points.

## GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
*   **Concept:** EU law on data protection and privacy; global benchmark.
*   **Applies if:** Processing personal data of EU residents.
*   **Key Principles (for Analysts):**
    *   **Lawfulness, Fairness, Transparency:** Clear, legal, and open processing.
    *   **Purpose Limitation:** Use data only for stated purpose.
    *   **Data Minimization:** Collect only necessary data.
    *   **Accuracy:** Keep data correct and up-to-date.
    *   **Storage Limitation:** Retain data only as long as needed.
    *   **Integrity & Confidentiality:** Secure processing.

## Data Protection Techniques
*   **Anonymization:** Irreversibly removing identifiers (data no longer PII).
*   **Pseudonymization:** Replacing identifiers with artificial ones (can be re-linked with separate key).

## Bias in Data & Algorithms
*   **Sources:** Data collection, sampling, measurement, algorithmic amplification.
*   **Types:** Selection bias, measurement bias, algorithmic bias.
*   **Mitigation:** Diverse data, fairness metrics, bias detection tools, Explainable AI (XAI).
