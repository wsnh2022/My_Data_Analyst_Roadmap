# Cheatsheet: Correlation (Pearson)

## Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r)
*   **Definition:** Measures the **linear relationship** between two **continuous numerical variables**.
*   **Range:** -1 to +1.
    *   `+1`: Perfect positive linear relationship.
    *   `-1`: Perfect negative linear relationship.
    *   `0`: No linear relationship.
*   **Interpretation:**
    *   **Sign:** Direction (positive/negative).
    *   **Magnitude:** Strength (closer to 1 or -1 means stronger).

## Key Limitations
*   **Correlation â‰  Causation:** Most critical point. A third, lurking variable might be the cause.
*   **Only Linear Relationships:** Fails to capture non-linear relationships (e.g., U-shaped).
*   **Sensitive to Outliers:** Extreme values can heavily influence the coefficient.

## Proficiency Levels Summary

### ðŸ”µ Basic
*   Define Pearson correlation.
*   Understand its range (-1 to +1).
*   Visually identify positive, negative, and no correlation on scatter plots.

### ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate
*   Interpret the strength of correlation (e.g., weak, moderate, strong).
*   Understand and explain the key limitations: correlation does not imply causation, only measures linear relationships, sensitive to outliers.
*   Apply to simple realistic examples (e.g., website traffic and sales).

### ðŸŸ¢ Strong
*   Always visualize data with scatter plots before interpreting `r` to confirm linearity and identify outliers.
*   Communicate nuances and limitations effectively to stakeholders.
*   Use correlation as a starting point for further investigation, not a definitive answer.
*   Apply to complex scenarios (e.g., employee engagement and productivity) and derive actionable insights while clearly stating caveats.
