# Cheatsheet: Presentation Design for Non-Data Stakeholders

## Core Concept
*   **Purpose:** Bridge the gap between complex analysis and a non-technical audience's need for clear, actionable information.
*   **Goal:** Simple, clear, and persuasive presentations.

## Understanding the Audience
*   **Priorities:** What does this mean for me/my department? What should I do? How does this impact our goals?
*   **Constraints:** Time-poor, may lack statistical background, overwhelmed by detail/jargon.

## Key Design Principles
*   **Bottom Line Up Front (BLUF):** Start with your main conclusion/recommendation.
*   **Focus on "So What?":** Emphasize business implications, not technical details.
*   **One Idea Per Slide:** Each slide conveys a single, clear message (title states main takeaway).
*   **Simplicity in Visuals:** Clean, uncluttered charts; maximize data-ink ratio.
*   **Strategic Color:** Use color to highlight, not decorate.
*   **Minimal Text:** Use bullet points, not paragraphs.
*   **Avoid Jargon:** Use plain language, analogies.

## Visual Elements
*   **Chart Choice:** Stick to easily understood charts (bar, line, simple pie).
*   **Clear Titles & Labels:** Essential for every visual.
*   **Annotations:** Highlight key findings directly on charts.
*   **Whitespace:** Use to improve readability.
