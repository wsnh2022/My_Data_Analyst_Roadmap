# Cheatsheet: Probability and Sampling

## Probability
*   **Definition:** The measure of the likelihood that an event will occur (0 to 1 or 0% to 100%).
*   **Formula (Single Event):** `P(Event) = (Number of Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Number of Possible Outcomes)`
*   **Types:**
    *   **Empirical:** Based on observed data/experiments.
    *   **Theoretical:** Based on logical reasoning/ideal conditions.

## Sampling
*   **Definition:** Selecting a subset (sample) from a larger group (population) to make inferences about the population.
*   **Purpose:** Cost/time efficiency, feasibility when population is too large.
*   **Goal:** Obtain a **representative sample** that accurately reflects the population.
*   **Sampling Bias:** Occurs when a sample is not representative, leading to inaccurate conclusions.

## Common Sampling Methods
*   **Simple Random Sampling:** Every individual has an equal chance of selection.
*   **Stratified Sampling:** Divide population into subgroups (strata), then random sample from each.
*   **Systematic Sampling:** Select every nth individual from a list.
*   **Convenience Sampling:** Selecting easily accessible individuals (high bias, generally avoid).
