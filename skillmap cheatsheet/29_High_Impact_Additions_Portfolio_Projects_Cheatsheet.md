# Cheatsheet: Portfolio Projects

## Core Concept
*   **Purpose:** A collection of projects showcasing your data analysis skills, thought process, and ability to deliver insights.
*   **Value:** Allows you to **show, not just tell**, potential employers what you can do.

## What Makes a Good Project?
*   **Clear Objective:** Starts with a well-defined business question/hypothesis.
*   **Relevant Data:** Interesting data that allows for meaningful analysis.
*   **Demonstrates Skills:** Shows data cleaning, EDA, analysis, insight generation.
*   **Clear Deliverable:** Well-commented notebook, public dashboard, report.
*   **Strong `README.md`:** The project's front page, explaining everything.

## Key Sections of a `README.md`
*   Project Title & Overview
*   Data Source
*   Methodology (high-level)
*   Key Findings/Insights
*   Tools Used
*   How to Run/View (instructions)

## Where to Host
*   **GitHub:** For code (Jupyter Notebooks, Python scripts, SQL queries) and `README.md`.
*   **Power BI Public / Tableau Public:** For interactive dashboards.
*   **Best Practice:** Combine both (GitHub repo with link to live dashboard).

## Project Ideas
*   Public datasets (Kaggle, UCI, government portals).
*   Topics you're passionate about.
*   Web scraping/API data acquisition.
*   Replicate interesting analyses.

## Proficiency Levels Summary

### ðŸ”µ Basic
*   Understand the importance of a portfolio for demonstrating skills.
*   Identify suitable project ideas using public datasets.
*   Focus on showcasing a few core skills (e.g., basic cleaning, simple visualization).
*   Deliver a project in a basic format (e.g., a Jupyter Notebook).

### ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate
*   Execute an **end-to-end data analysis project** (from problem definition to insights).
*   Create clear and comprehensive **`README.md` documentation** for your projects.
*   Host your projects on **GitHub** to demonstrate version control skills.
*   Generate actionable insights from your analysis.

### ðŸŸ¢ Strong
*   Craft projects that tell a **compelling data story**.
*   Utilize **advanced visualizations** (e.g., interactive dashboards on Power BI Public/Tableau Public).
*   Provide **clear, actionable, and quantified recommendations**.
*   Acquire data from non-traditional sources (web scraping, APIs).
*   Incorporate more complex statistical modeling or A/B testing analysis.
*   Focus on quality over quantity, creating polished, impactful projects that demonstrate strategic thinking.
