# Cheatsheet: Mean, Median, Mode

## Mean (Average)
*   **Definition:** Sum of all values divided by the count of values.
*   **Use Case:** Symmetrical data, no significant outliers.
*   **Sensitivity:** Highly sensitive to outliers.
*   **Formula:** `(Sum of all values) / (Number of values)`

## Median (Middle Value)
*   **Definition:** The middle value of a dataset when sorted. If even number of values, average of the two middle values.
*   **Use Case:** Skewed data or data with outliers.
*   **Sensitivity:** Robust to outliers.
*   **How to find:** Sort data, then find middle value(s).

## Mode (Most Frequent Value)
*   **Definition:** The value that appears most often in a dataset.
*   **Use Case:** Categorical data, finding most popular item.
*   **Characteristics:** Can have one, multiple, or no modes.

## Proficiency Levels Summary

### ðŸ”µ Basic
*   Define each term.
*   Calculate for simple, small datasets.

### ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate
*   Understand *when* to use each measure (e.g., median for skewed data).
*   Explain the impact of outliers on the mean vs. median.
*   Provide realistic examples for each.

### ðŸŸ¢ Strong
*   Confidently choose the most appropriate measure for a given dataset/problem.
*   Justify the choice based on data distribution and business context.
*   Communicate insights effectively, highlighting nuances (e.g., reporting both mean and median when outliers are present).
*   Apply to real-world scenarios (e.g., wait times, salaries) and derive actionable insights.
