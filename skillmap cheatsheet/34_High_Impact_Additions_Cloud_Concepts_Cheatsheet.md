# Cheatsheet: Cloud Concepts

## Core Concept
*   **Definition:** On-demand delivery of IT resources (servers, storage, databases, etc.) over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.
*   **Analogy:** Like electricity â€“ you consume and pay for what you use, don't own the power plant.

## Key Benefits
*   **Scalability:** Easily scale resources up/down as needed.
*   **Cost-Effectiveness:** Pay only for what you use; no large upfront investments.
*   **Flexibility:** Access resources from anywhere.
*   **Reliability:** High availability and disaster recovery built-in.
*   **Agility:** Rapid deployment and provisioning of resources.

## Cloud Deployment Models
*   **Public Cloud:** Owned/operated by third-party provider (AWS, Azure, GCP).
*   **Private Cloud:** Exclusive to one organization.
*   **Hybrid Cloud:** Combination of public and private.

## Cloud Service Models (The "-as-a-Service" Pyramid)
*   **SaaS (Software as a Service):** Ready-to-use applications over the internet (e.g., Power BI Service, Salesforce).
    *   *You manage:* Nothing (just use the software).
*   **PaaS (Platform as a Service):** Development/deployment environment; provider manages infrastructure, OS, middleware (e.g., AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine).
    *   *You manage:* Your application code and data.
*   **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):** Basic computing resources (VMs, storage, networks); provider manages hardware (e.g., AWS EC2, Azure VMs).
    *   *You manage:* OS, applications, data.

## Core Cloud Data Services (Conceptual)
*   **Cloud Storage:** Scalable object storage (e.g., Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage).
*   **Cloud Data Warehouses:** Optimized for analytical queries on large, structured data (e.g., Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery).
*   **Cloud Databases:** Managed relational/NoSQL databases (e.g., Amazon RDS).
*   **Data Lakes:** Centralized repository for raw, structured/unstructured data (often built on cloud storage).
*   **Serverless Computing:** Run code without managing servers (e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Functions).

## Proficiency Levels Summary

### ðŸ”µ Basic
*   Understand what cloud computing is (on-demand IT resources over the internet).
*   Identify the main benefits (scalability, cost-effectiveness, flexibility).
*   Recognize common public cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP).

### ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate
*   Differentiate between the three main cloud service models: **SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS**.
*   Be familiar with the core cloud services relevant to data analysis (cloud storage, data warehouses, databases, data lakes).
*   Understand how different cloud services fit together in a basic data pipeline.

### ðŸŸ¢ Strong
*   Understand basic **cloud architecture patterns** (e.g., serverless computing, data pipelines).
*   Consider **cost implications** of cloud usage and basic optimization strategies.
*   Be aware of fundamental **security and compliance** aspects in the cloud (shared responsibility model, IAM, encryption).
*   Contribute to the design of robust, scalable, and cost-effective cloud-based data solutions.
*   Familiarity with specific cloud data tools (e.g., AWS S3, Google BigQuery, Azure Data Factory).
