# Cheatsheet: Power BI / Tableau

## Core Purpose
*   **Business Intelligence (BI) Tools:** Visualize and analyze data to make better decisions.
*   **Primary Function:** Create interactive dashboards and reports.
*   **Workflow:** Connect > Transform > Model > Visualize > Share.

## Key Components
*   **Data Sources:** Connect to various sources (Excel, SQL, Web, etc.).
*   **Data Model:** Define relationships between tables (e.g., star schema).
*   **Dimensions:** Categorical fields (e.g., Region, Product Category) used for slicing/dicing.
*   **Measures:** Numerical fields (e.g., Sales, Profit) used for aggregation.
*   **Visualizations:** Charts, graphs, tables to represent data.
*   **Dashboards/Reports:** Collection of interactive visualizations.

## Common Visualizations
*   **Trends:** Line Chart.
*   **Comparisons:** Bar/Column Chart.
*   **Parts-to-Whole:** Pie Chart (use sparingly), Stacked Bar Chart.
*   **Relationships:** Scatter Plot.
*   **Distributions:** Histogram, Box Plot.
*   **Geographical:** Map.

## Interactivity
*   **Filters/Slicers:** Allow users to dynamically filter data.
*   **Cross-Filtering/Highlighting:** Clicking on one visual updates others.
*   **Drill-through/Drill-down:** Navigate from summary to detail.

## Calculations
*   **Power BI (DAX):** Measures (`SUM`, `CALCULATE`), Calculated Columns.
*   **Tableau (Calculated Fields):** `SUM`, `AVG`, `LOD Expressions` (`FIXED`, `INCLUDE`, `EXCLUDE`).

## Proficiency Levels Summary

### ðŸ”µ Basic
*   Understand the purpose of BI tools.
*   Connect to common data sources (Excel, CSV).
*   Create basic visualizations (bar, line, pie) by dragging and dropping fields.
*   Assemble simple, static dashboards with clear titles.

### ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate
*   Build simple data models by creating relationships between tables.
*   Incorporate interactivity using filters/slicers and cross-filtering.
*   Create basic calculations (e.g., `Total Sales`, `Average Order Value`).
*   Design dashboards with a specific audience in mind, applying basic visual design principles (whitespace, consistent colors).

### ðŸŸ¢ Strong
*   Design and implement complex data models (e.g., advanced star schemas, many-to-many relationships).
*   Write sophisticated calculations (e.g., advanced DAX `CALCULATE`, Time Intelligence; Tableau LODs, Table Calculations).
*   Optimize dashboard performance for large datasets.
*   Implement advanced visualization techniques (e.g., custom visuals, drill-through, bookmarks).
*   Apply User Experience (UX) principles to create intuitive and impactful dashboards that tell a compelling data story.
