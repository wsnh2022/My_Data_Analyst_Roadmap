# Cheatsheet: Standard Deviation and Variance

## Variance (ÏƒÂ² or sÂ²)
*   **Definition:** The average of the squared differences from the Mean.
*   **Purpose:** Measures how far each number in the set is from the average, on average.
*   **Units:** Squared units of the original data (e.g., if data is in dollars, variance is in squared dollars).
*   **Sensitivity:** Sensitive to outliers due to squaring differences.

## Standard Deviation (Ïƒ or s)
*   **Definition:** The square root of the Variance.
*   **Purpose:** The most commonly used measure of spread, bringing the measure back to the original units of the data.
*   **Units:** Same units as the original data.
*   **Interpretation:** A low standard deviation indicates data points are close to the mean; a high standard deviation indicates data points are spread out.

## Proficiency Levels Summary

### ðŸ”µ Basic
*   Understand that both measure data spread/dispersion around the mean.
*   Conceptually differentiate between variance (squared units) and standard deviation (original units).
*   Visually identify datasets with low vs. high spread.

### ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate
*   Calculate variance and standard deviation for small datasets (manually or with simple tools).
*   Interpret the calculated values in context (e.g., "on average, data points are X units from the mean").
*   Apply to realistic examples (e.g., daily temperature fluctuations) to compare consistency.

### ðŸŸ¢ Strong
*   Use standard deviation to assess risk and volatility (e.g., in finance).
*   Compare distributions beyond just their means, using standard deviation to highlight differences in consistency (e.g., quality control).
*   Communicate insights effectively, explaining the implications of different levels of spread to non-technical stakeholders.
*   Understand the role of these measures in statistical tests and modeling.
